2. Methods used
3. How it can be used
4. Credits and Highlights

1.  The final Capstone project covers Image Processing using the MNIST dataset.  It uses machine learning techniques built into Python to show accuracy and precision of the image processiing task.

2.  It is provided as a Jupyter Notebook.  It could also be run as a standalone Python program.  It was created on the VS Code platform.

3.  It can be used to show the effects of tuning machine learning on a known dataset.

4.  The MNIST dataset was produced and provided by MNIST, short for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, is a dataset consisting of images showing handwritten digits from 0 to 9 (both inclusive).

The work was carried out by the author, Edward Reed, working to a bootcamp specification provided by Hyperion Dev (https://www.hyperiondev.com/)
